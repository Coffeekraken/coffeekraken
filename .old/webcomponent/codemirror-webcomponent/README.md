##Â Get Started

First, import the component into your javascript file like so:

```js
import CoremirrorWebcomponent from '@coffeekraken/codemirror/webcomponent'
```

Then simply use it inside your html like so:

```html
<ck-codemirror language="html">
	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p>Proin efficitur, lectus nec pulvinar bibendum, magna metus consequat elit.</p>
</ck-codemirror>
```

> You can wrap your content inside a ```<template></template>``` tag in order to avoid unnecessary computation.

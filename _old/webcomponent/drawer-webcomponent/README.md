##Â Get Started

First, import the component into your javascript file like so:

```js
import DrawerWebcomponent from '@coffeekraken/drawer-webcomponent'
```

Then simply use it inside your html like so:

```html
<ck-drawer name="menu">
	<!-- your drawer content -->
</ck-drawer>
<main is="ck-drawer-content">
	<!-- your main website content -->
	<label for="menu">
		Open menu drawer
	</label>
</main>
```

If you need some default styles for your drawer, follow theses steps:

```scss
// import the drawer-webcomponent API
@use 'node_modules/@coffeekraken/drawer-webcomponent' as drawer-webcomponent;

// generate the classes
@include drawer-webcomponent.classes(
	$name: my-cool-drawer
	$side: right
);

// customize the drawer overlay
@include drawer-webcomponent.element(overlay, my-cool-drawer) {
	background-color: red;
}
```

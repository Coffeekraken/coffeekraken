## SBench

This `SBench` class allows you to know how many time take a certain part of your processes, with a concept of "steps" to split this even more when needed. Here's the features availables:

-   Track the time used by a portion of script
-   Display a summary of tracked times
-   Split your tracked portion into "steps" for more precision
-   Let the `SBench` related statements into your code and filter out which bench(s) you want to be active and which not

## Usage

Here's how to use our implementation:

```js
import __SBench from '@coffeekraken/s-bench';
const bench = new __SBench('myCoolProcess');
// something...
bench.step('afterSomething');
// something else...
bench.end().log();
```

##Â Get Started

First, import the component into your javascript file like so:

```js
import SSelectComponent from "@coffeekraken/s-select-component";
```

Then simply use it inside your html like so:

```html
<select is="s-select">
  <option value="value1">Hello</option>
  <option value="value2">World</option>
  <optgroup label="My Cool Group">
    <option value="value3">My Cool Option</option>
  </optgroup>
</select>
```

If you need some styling to start with, you can generate it like so:

```scss
@import "node_modules/@coffeekraken/s-select-component/index";
// only a base bare styling
@include s-select-classes-bare();
// ...and optionally the visual styles
@include s-select-classes-style($colors: default primary secondary);
// ...or generate directly the bare and style classes
@include s-select-classes($colors: default primary secondary);
```

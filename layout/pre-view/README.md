## Install

```
npm install @coffeekraken/pre-view --save
```

<a name="readme-get-started"></a>

## Get Started

First, create a file named `pre-view.config.js` at the root of your project. Here's a config sample

```js
module.exports = {
  folder: `${process.cwd()}/views`,
  watch: `${process.cwd()}/dist`,
  hostname: '127.0.0.1',
  open: true,
  hotkey_selector: 'command+enter',
  hotkey_states: 'ctrl+enter',
  js: 'dist/js/app.bundle.js',
  css: 'dist/css/style.css',
  states: '100%,768px,480px'
}
```

Then create a `views` folder also at the root of your project. You can then create the folder structure you want in this folder. The only rule that you have to follow is to name your views `[name].blade.php` or `[name].twig.php`.

The last installation process is to add a script in your `package.json` like so:

```json
{
  ...
  scripts: {
    "pre-view": "ck-pre-view [...config]"
  },
  ...
}
```

You can then launch your pre-view instance by typing: `npm run pre-view`

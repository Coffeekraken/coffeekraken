# Overview

Component in Coffeekraken is very important part of our vision, and this, even is as everything else, they can be used or not inside your project. Totally your decision.

## What are components?

We call `component` everything that takes place inside your HTML like a `button`, a form `input`, etc...

Inside the component category, we also include `web`components. These are new custom elements that you can use within your HTML like `s-date-picker`, `s-color-picker`, `s-panel`, etc...

## Official components

Here's the list of currently official available components:


And here's the list of our official `web`components:


## Components MUST follow some simple rules

All the components that we provide follows these simple rules:

1. A component **MUST** be as customizable as possible
2. A component **MUST** provide at least 2 `scopes`. (see bellow for more information)
3. A component **MUST** work out of the box without anything more to do
4. A component **MUST** follow your `theme` specifications if the `lnf` (look and feel) `scope` is applied

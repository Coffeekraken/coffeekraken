# Supported formats

As described in the overview, the supported formats are:

- `.jpg`
- `.png`
- `.gif`
- `.svg`
- `.webp`

These file types are the most common in web today. Here's what we can say about each of them in the Coffeekraken world:

## JPG

`.jpg` files are the main and most used format today for images that does not need transparency.

This format is perfect for photography, profile images, etc...

## PNG

`.png` files are the equivalent of the `.jpg` files with the huge difference that they support transparency.

This format if perfect for website decoration images, composition images like layers in a complex (animated) section, etc...

> Try to not use this image format for things like logo, icons, etc... For that, the `.svg` format is the one to choose

## SVG

`.svg` files are the perfect file type for all vector based images like logo, icons, as well as everything you may need to resize a lot through your website.

> `SVG` is more that just an image file type. It's an equivalent of HTML to describe vector based images. This mean that you can manipulate them using `javascript`, etc...

## GIF

`.gif` files are animated images. This is a pretty of format and you may prefer video formats like `.mp4`, etc...

> This file format is more used and known for making small "crappy" animated images sent across our messaging apps like Whatapp, Telegram, etc...

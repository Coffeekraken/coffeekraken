# First project creation

To create a new project, simply enter this command:

```shell
sugar new
```

This will launch a quick and easy step by step creation process that will ask you for the project name, the [recipe](#recipes) to use, etc...

> **[Recipe](#recipes)** is the term used in the coffeekraken environment for **"project template"**

Once this process is done, you can start working on your project. If you choose to **not launch the development process** at the end of the step by step creation process, simply enter this command:

```shell
sugar dev
```

## Start developing

```shell
sugar dev
```

That will launch some processes like:

###### **frontendServer**

More on this server in the [@coffeekraken/s-frontend-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coffeekraken/s-sfrontend-server) package documentation

###### **vitejs**

This server is powered by the AWESOME [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) project and is responsible to compile and serve on the fly your assets like javascript and typescript files, css through [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), and more...

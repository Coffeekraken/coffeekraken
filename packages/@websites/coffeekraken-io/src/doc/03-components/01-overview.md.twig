# Overview

Component in Coffeekraken is very important part of our vision, and this, even is as everything else, they can be used or not inside your project. Totally your decision.

## What are components?

We call `component` everything that takes place inside your HTML like a `button`, a form `input`, etc...

Inside the component category, we also include `web`components. These are new custom elements that you can use within your HTML like `s-date-picker`, `s-color-picker`, `s-panel`, etc...

## Official components

Here's the list of currently official available components:

{% for key, slug in docmap.menu.custom.styleguide.slug %}
{% if '/styleguide/ui' in key and '-component' not in key %}
- [**{{ slug.name }}**]({{key}})
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

And here's the list of our official `web`components:

{% for key, obj in docmap.menu.custom.styleguide.slug %}
{% if '-component' in key %}
- [**{{ obj.name }}**](/package/{{key}}/doc/readme)
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Components MUST follow some simple rules

All the components that we provide follows these simple rules:

1. A component **MUST** be as customizable as possible
2. A component **MUST** provide at least 2 `scopes`:
    1. The "**bare**" scope that contain all the structural css for your component to work.
        - Usually loaded directly in your JS file.
    2. The "**lnf**" (look and feel) scope that provides optional visual styling.
        - Usually provided through a `@sugar.ui.componentName.classes` mixin
        - **MUST** take in consideration the theme configurations.
3. A component **MUST** work out of the box without anything more to do
4. A component **MUST** follow your `theme` specifications if the `lnf` (look and feel) `scope` is applied

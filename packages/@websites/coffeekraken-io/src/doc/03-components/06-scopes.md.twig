# Scopes

What are these `scopes`?

To be quick and as descriptive as possible, `scopes` are simply the whole style applied to a `button` (for example) splited into different parts.

Here's the base list of `scopes` that a component **MUST** use:

1. `bare`: This scope named `bare` represent all the structural CSS of the component. For a button, this will contain:
   - `font-size` property
   - `display` property
   - `padding` property(ies)
   - `cursor` property
   - etc...
2. `lnf`: This scope named `lnf` (look and feel) represent all the visual CSS of the component. This can be:
   - `color` property
   - `background` property
   - `border` property
   - `font-family` property
   - etc...

> With these scopes defined, you can choose if you want integrate a component with all his CSS, only the `bare` scope and apply your own visual style to it, or take only the `lnf` scope which it less meaningful alone...

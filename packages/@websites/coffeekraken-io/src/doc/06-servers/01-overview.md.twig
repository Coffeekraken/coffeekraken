# Servers overview

The Coffeekraken stack take advantage of some servers that you don't have to take care of.
You certainly can update their configurations to match you needs if wanted. Here's a quick overview of the servers usually used by our stack:

## SFrontendServer

This server if the one that handle the most of the requests made during development process. It handle:

1. Views compilation (twig, blade, etc...).
2. Easy to use routing system based on **folder structure**.
3. Simple views data providing system.
4. And more...

> For more information on the SFrontendServer, please take a look at [this README](/@coffeekraken/s-frontend-server/README)

## Vitejs

Coffeekraken take advantage of the AMAZING [ViteJs](https://vitejs.dev/) package to serve and compile assets like CSS and JS/TS ones.

# Icons

Icons are very important these days in web design/development. The bad part of this is that icons are often coming from different sources like [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Google icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons), some others or even plain SVG files.

This make the treatment and usage of these icons a pain in the ass to say at least...

Our solution to this is the `@s.icon.classes` mixin that let you register all of your icons from different sources and use them down the line with a single class syntax the looks like `.s-icon:user`.

> Your final icons will be generated in a **font-icon format** so you can apply them colors, and all features a text can have.

## Register some icons

To register some icons, simply call the `@s.icon.classes` mixin with the list of icons you want in your website like so:

```css
@s.icon.classes (
    fab:vuejs
    fa:tasks
    fa:hammer:todo
    fs:src/icons/read-direction.svg:support-rtl
    fs:src/icons/ *.svg
    {# sugar:ui-help-solid:help #}
);
```

Each line define an icon using this syntax:

`{protocol}:{name-or-path}:{internal-name-you-want}`

-   `protocol`: This define the source of the icon. See bellow the list of supported ones
-   `name-or-path`: This define the name or path where to find your icon
-   `internal-name-you-want`: This is optional and let you change the name to use which one you want internally

## Protocols

For now, we support 2 protocols that are:

- `fa|fab|fas|fad|fal`: These are [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons
- `fs`: This is `filesystem` plain SVG icons
    -   Support glob paths like `src/icons/*.svg`
{# - `sugar`: Access the sugar icons (list bellow) #}

> These are the supported protocols that we have for now. We can as well add some depending on your needs and requests through our different communication channels.

## Usage

To use your registered icons, simply reference them inside your html like so:

```html
<i class="s-icon:vuejs"></i>
<i class="s-icon:support-rtl"></i>
<!-- etc... -->
```

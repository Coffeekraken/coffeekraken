# What are recipes?

A recipe is more and less a project template that will allows you to generate and start working on particular project as quickly as possible.

Each recipe comes with these built-in capabilities:

1. Project files and folders structure
2. Dependencies already defined for you
3. 1 command full development stack (server, compilers, etc...)
4. 1 command production ready build stack (minification, bundling, etc...)
5. Extensability as a recipe is nothing more that a "template"

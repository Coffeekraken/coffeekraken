# More on configuration

As the configuration is built on the [@coffeekraken/s-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coffeekraken/s-config) package, you can go check this package documentation to have a more in depth loop on how it works under the hood.

We recommand that to people that wants to create packages that need to expose some configurations to the outside world and take advantage of the full [@coffeekraken/s-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coffeekraken/s-config) package power like:

-   Adapters
-   `prepare` function
-   Inter-configuration referencing
-   Environment aware config
-   and more...

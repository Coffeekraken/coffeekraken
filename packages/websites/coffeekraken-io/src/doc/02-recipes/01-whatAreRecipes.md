# What are recipes?

A recipe is more and less **a project template** that will allows you to generate and start working on particular project as quickly as possible.

Each recipe comes with these built-in capabilities:

1. Project **files and folders structure**
2. Dependencies already defined for you
3. **1 command full development stack** (server, compilers, etc...)
4. **1 command production ready build stack** (minification, bundling, etc...)
5. **Extensability** as a recipe is nothing more that a "template"

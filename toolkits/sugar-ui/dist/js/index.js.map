The difference is that you have more control on this one like\n * the possibility to resolve it multiple times. Here's a list of the \"differences\" and the \"features\" that this class provide:\n *\n * - Pass the normal \"resolve\" and \"reject\" function to the passed executor\n * - Pass a new function to the passed executor called \"trigger\" that let you launch your registered callbacks like \"then\", \"catch\", etc... but without resolving the master promise. Here's some examples:\n *    - new SPromise((resolve, reject, trigger, cancel) => { trigger('then', 'myCoolValue'); }).then(value => { ... });\n *    - new SPromise((resolve, reject, trigger, cancel) => { trigger('then,catch', 'myCoolValue') }).then(value => { ... });\n * - Pass a new function to the passed executor called \"cancel\" that let you stop/cancel the promise execution without triggering your registered callbacks unless the \"cancel\" once...\n * - Expose the normal \"then\" and \"catch\" methods to register your callbacks\n * - Expose some new callbacks registration functions described here:\n *    - Expose a method called \"resolved\" that let you register callbacks called only when the \"resolve\" function has been called\n *    - Expose a method called \"rejected\" that let you register callbacks called only when the \"reject\" function has been called\n *    - Expose a method called \"finally\" that let you register callbacks called when the \"resolve\" or \"reject\" function has been called\n *    - Expose a method called \"canceled\" that let you register callbacks called only when the \"cancel\" function has been called\n * - Every callbacks registration methods accept as first argument the number of time that your callback will be called at max. Here's some examples:\n *    - new SPromise((...)).then(value => { // do something... }).catch(error => { // do something... });\n *    - new SPromise((...)).then(1, value => { // do something... }).catch(3, error => { // do something... });\n * - Expose a method called \"on\" that can be used to register callbacks the same as the \"then\", \"catch\", etc... methods but you can register a same callback function to multiple callbacks type at once:\n *    - new SPromise((...)).on('then', value => { ... }).on('then,catch', value => { ... });\n *    - Specify the max number of time to call your callback function like so: new SPromise((...)).on('then:2', value => { ... }).on('then:1,catch', value => { ... });\n * - A new method called \"start\" is exposed. This method is useful when you absolutely need that your executor function is launched right after the callbacks registrations.\n *    - If you don't call the \"start\" method, the executor function passed to the SPromise constructor will be called on the next javascript execution loop\n * - Support the Promises chaining through the callbacks like to:\n *    ```js\n *      const result = await new SPromise((resolve, reject, trigger, cancel) => {\n *        resolve('hello');\n *      }).then(value => {\n *        return new Promise((resolve) => {\n *          setTimeout(() => {\n *            resolve(value + 'World');\n *          }, 1000);\n *        });\n *      }).then(value => {\n *        return value + 'Promise';\n *      });\n *      console.log(result); // => helloWorldPromise\n *    ```\n *\n * @example         js\n * import SPromise from '@coffeekraken/sugar/js/promise/SPromise';\n * function myCoolFunction() {\n *    return new SPromise((resolve, reject, trigger, cancel) => {\n *        // do something...\n *        setInterval(() => {\n *            // resolve the promise\n *            resolve('something'); *\n *        }, 1000);\n *    });\n * }\n *\n * // calling the function and get back the SPromise instance\n * myCoolFunction().then(value => {\n *    // do something here...\n * }).then(1, value => {\n *    // do something just once...\n * }).catch(error => {\n *    // do something with the returned reason of failure...\n * });\n *\n * @author \t\tOlivier Bossel<olivier.bossel@gmail.com>\n */\nvar SPromise = /*#__PURE__*/function (_Promise) {\n  _inherits(SPromise, _Promise);\n\n  var _super = _createSuper(SPromise);\n\n  _createClass(SPromise, null, [{\n    key: \"map\",\n\n    /**\n     * @name                  _settings\n     * @type                  Object\n     * @private\n     *\n     * Store the settings of this SPromise instance.
